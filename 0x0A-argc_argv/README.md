0x0A. C - argc, argv

argc and argv are parameters typically used in the main function of a C or C++ program to handle command-line arguments. They are essential for passing arguments to a program when it is run from the command line.

argc (Argument Count): argc is an integer that represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program, including the program name itself. It is always at least 1 because the first argument is the program's name.

argv (Argument Vector): argv is an array of strings (an array of pointers to characters) that holds the actual command-line arguments. Each element of the argv array is a string representing one of the arguments. The first element, argv[0], is the program name.
