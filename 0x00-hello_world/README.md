- Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
- Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file.
- Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.

- Write a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
- Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
- Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file.
- Write a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
