# 0x14. C - Bit manipulation

- Bit manipulation in C involves using bitwise operators to perform operations at the bit level. The main bitwise operators in C are:

AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation.
OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation.
XOR (^): Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation.
NOT (~): Performs a bitwise NOT operation.
Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits to the left.
Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits to the right.

## TASK
### Mandatory
- Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
- Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
- Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
- Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
### Advanced 
- Write a function that checks the endianness.
- Find the password for this program.
